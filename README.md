# Overview

I wrote this software with the intent to learn more about encryption. I'm interested in backend languages such as
C++ and Java. This software is also to practice my Java skills.

The software receives a text and using encryption library from Java to do it.

# Development Environment

I'm using a Java built-in library called crypto for encryption.

I'm using Java for this program and using IntelliJ IDEA as my IDE.

# Status

This program is still in production so is not completed yet. The encryption method is working, but I'm still
working on the decryption process.

# Future Steps

Once I have the backend up and running I will implement a GUI on the software. Swing most likely.
